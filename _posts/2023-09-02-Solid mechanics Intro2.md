# Advanced Solid mechanics Design Intro2

- Engineering Design  vs  Design Optimization

  - Engineering design : Aims to find(determine) a design(demensions and materials) to meet well-defined specifications

    - Procedures

      1. Generate a large number of potential solution (Conceptual design)

      2. Choose few candidates by evaluating cost, weight, max stress, and/or manufacturability

         (size reduction result in cost saving, bus raise possibility of mechanical failure)

      3. Choose one to two candidates, fabricate prototype, and test

  - Design Optimization : Aims to find and optimal design for maximizing a specific performance functions 
                                           with meeting the requirement defined as constraint
                                           e.g. 
                                                      Minimize  cost
                                                      Subject to $\sigma_{max} \leq \sigma_{allowalbe}$



- Review of solid mechanics under various loading
  - long, straight, slender members used to support mechanical load.
    - Truss : only axial loading
    - Frame : multi axial loading
    - Beam : Forces at various points
    - Cable : withstand only tension
