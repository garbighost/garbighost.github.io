&#42; Two approaches in structural Analysis for finding stress and displacement distribution of loaded structure.

1. ​	Direct approach (Related to "Strong Form" approach)
   - Solve equilibrium equation and boundary conditions "Directly" to determine displacement or stress.
   - Equilibrium equation (Governing equation) is derived from linear momentum conversation law (simply $\sum F = ma\$)
2. Energy approach (Related to "Weak Form" approach)
   - Subset of broader class of methods based on "Variational method"
   - Fundamentals for "Finite element method (FEM)"

- Concept of two approaches in spring-mass system.
