- Functional
  - In linear algebra, it is synonymous with a linear form, which is a linear mapping from a vector space $V$ into its field of scalars
  
  - In functional analysis and related fields, it refer more generally to a mapping from a space $X$ into the field of real or complex numbers. In functional analysis, the term linear functional is a synonym of linear form. that is, it is a scalar-valued linear map. Depending on the author, such mappings may or may not be assumed to be linear, or be defined on the whole space $X$. 
    - In the case where the space $X$ is a space of functions, the functional is a "function of a function", and some older authors actually define the term "functional" to mean "function of a function". However, the fact that $X$ is a space of functions is not mathematically essential, so this older definition is no longer prevalent.

      The [Riemann integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_integral) is a [linear functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_functional) on the vector space of functions defined on [*a*, *b*] that are Riemann-integrable from *a* to *b*.
